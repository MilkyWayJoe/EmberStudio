EmberStudio
===========

A Visual Studio Project Template for Ember.js + Bootstrap + ASP.NET MVC 4

Usage
=====

The easiest way, at the moment, to get the `Ember Web Application` template into 
Visual Studio is to download the `.zip` file provided by github above.

Then, extract all the files, which will live in a subdirectory call `EmberStudio-master`.

From inside that subdirectory, select all files, right-click, and select `Send To > Compressed (zipped) Folder`.

Rename the resulting file `Ember Web Application.zip`, and move it into 
`Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Templates\ProjectTemplates`
or `Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Templates\ProjectTemplates`.

That's it! Now go to `New > Project` and select the `Ember Web Application` template. When it's done, 
just press F5 and enjoy the emberjs/ember.js love.

Roadmap
=======

A VISX version will appear shortly in the Visual Studio Gallery. Shortly thereafter, we'll be adding
item templates for views, controllers, routes, models, and helpers.
